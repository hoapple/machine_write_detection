# COMP90051 AI-Generated Text Detection Report - Group 47

As large language models (LLMs) evolve, machines are becoming increasingly adept at producing text that resembles human writing. This advancement in AI, if misused, can lead to serious consequences such as the dissemination of fake news, misinformation, intellectual property infringements, and the creation of deceptive product reviews, leading to detrimental effects (Chakraborty et al., 2023). Therefore, there is a pressing need to devise algorithms that can discern between machine-generated and human-written texts.

This study addresses the challenge of detecting AI-generated text by crafting a binary machine learning classifier. We explored and compared the efficacy of Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
